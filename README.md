# 🎭 Sentiment Analysis – IMDb Movie Reviews

This project was submitted as **Task 4** under the **CODTECH Data Analytics Internship**, focused on building a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) on IMDb movie reviews.

## 🎯 Objective
To classify movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** using NLP and a Logistic Regression model.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn
- CountVectorizer
- Logistic Regression
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔁 Workflow
- Cleaned and preprocessed review text (removed HTML, punctuation, stopwords)
- Encoded sentiment labels (positive → 1, negative → 0)
- Converted text to numerical features using `CountVectorizer`
- Split data into training and test sets
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model
- Evaluated the model using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in binary sentiment classification
- Positive and negative reviews were clearly distinguishable using basic NLP techniques
- Demonstrated a working NLP pipeline for text classification
